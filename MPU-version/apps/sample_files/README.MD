* tee_client_api.h
* tee_common.h

## Sample file to design a custom fortified build process (modification needed based on application requirements)

* Makefile
* STM32L475VGTX_FLASH.ld


For more information about the compilation process for the Fortified Application, see the main README file for the Baremetal TEE with MPU.
